            <h3><em>The History of Python: From a Dutch Idea to a Global Phenomenon</em></h3>
            <p class="post-meta">Published: September 6, 2025 | Category: Programming</p>

            <h2>The Python programming language is a powerful tool that has changed the world of information technology.</h2>

            <h3>But how did it all begin?</h3>

            <p>Its story starts in the late 1980s in the Netherlands, specifically at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. It was there that Guido van Rossum, a talented programmer, began working on a new language. He wanted to create something that would combine simplicity and readability with powerful capabilities. He was looking for an alternative to the ABC language, which he found too rigid, but he appreciated its clear syntax.</p>

            <p>Van Rossum enthusiastically began work on the project in December 1989, aiming to create a language that would be ideal for programmers. The name "Python" does not come from the snake, as one might think, but from the British comedy group Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Van Rossum was a big fan. üêç</p>

            <h1>The Evolution and Key Features of Python</h1>

            <h3>The Birth of Python 1.0</h3>

            <p>The first official version, Python 1.0, was released in January 1994. It introduced key elements that are still at the heart of the language today, such as object-oriented programming, module support, and dynamic typing. It quickly gained popularity, mainly due to its simplicity and readability.</p>

            <h3>Python 2.0 and the Breakthrough</h3>

            <p>An important moment in Python's history was the release of version 2.0 in 2000. It introduced list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists, and garbage collection with reference cycles. This was a real breakthrough that increased performance and made writing code easier.</p>

            <h3>Python 3.0 and the Modern Era</h3>

            <p>The most important, yet most controversial, step was the release of Python 3.0 in 2008. This version was not backward-compatible, which forced programmers to rewrite parts of their code. The changes included improvements in text handling, print() became a function instead of a statement, and many other enhancements. Although this decision initially met with mixed reactions, today Python 3 is the industry standard.</p>

            <h2>Python in Practice: From Web Development to Machine Learning</h2>

            <p>Today, Python is one of the most popular languages in the world.  It is used in many fields, including:</p>

            <p><em>Web development (Django, Flask).</em></p>

            <p><em>Data analysis and machine learning (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow).</em></p>

            <p><em>Process automation and system scripting.</em></p>

            <p>Its versatility and growing popularity make Python an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers. It is no wonder that so many innovative projects are being created in this language. An example is the <a href="index_saks_en.html" style="color: azure;">Autostart Kajotte Studio System</a>, which was written entirely in Python, a testament to its flexibility and power.</p>

            <p>Python is not just a tool; it's an entire community that constantly works to improve it. Its simple and intuitive syntax makes it ideal for rapid prototyping and implementing advanced solutions. We are curious to see what other groundbreaking projects will be created with its help!</p>
