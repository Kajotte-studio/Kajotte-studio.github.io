                <h1 class="section-title" style="font-size: 3.5rem; color: #007bff;">Kajotte Studio Autostart System</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">Kajotte Studio Autostart System (SAKS) is an innovative project that we have been developing with passion and precision since January 2023. It is a coherent ecosystem of programs written in Python, created to increase security and automate work on your computer. SAKS runs in the background, unnoticed, to provide full control over the device.</p>
                <h1 class="section-title" style="font-size: 3.5rem; color: #007bff;">How Does It Work?</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">The core of the system is the Login program, which acts as the central manager. To access the full functionality of SAKS, a successful login is required. With this solution, you can be sure that only authorized persons have access to your system.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">SAKS is an intelligent system. Programs running in the background monitor key events on your device. They automatically log information such as:
                <br>* Computer startup and shutdown
                <br>* Start and end of battery charging
                <br>* Successful login to the Login program</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">All these events are instantly logged and sent as notifications. The system automatically sends email messages, informing you of the most important events. In addition, key notifications can be displayed as Windows notifications, giving you full control over your device and keeping you up to date with its activity.</p>
                <h1 class="section-title" style="font-size: 3.5rem; color: #007bff;">Security First</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">One of the most important elements of SAKS is a unique security system based on a physical key. Starting the computer without the dedicated USB key results in the device automatically shutting down and blocking access to the entire system.
                <br>This solution guarantees that your data and programs are safe, even in case of unauthorized access attempts.
                <br>SAKS is the future of automation and security.
                <br>It is not just software, but a well-thought-out architecture that works for you 24/7.</p>
                <h1 class="section-title" style="font-size: 3.5rem; color: #007bff;">Kajotte Studio</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; color: black;">Welcome to Kajotte Studio – a place where passion for creation meets precision and modern technology.

                <h1 class="section-title" style="font-size: 3.5rem; color: #007bff;">What Makes Us Stand Out?</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">Our versatile approach allows us to implement projects that go beyond traditional frameworks. Whether you need a professional commercial video, innovative software, or a modern website, Kajotte Studio combines various competencies into a coherent whole. We are ready to take on any challenge, adapting to your needs and expectations.
                <br>At Kajotte Studio, we believe that every project deserves an individual approach and the highest quality of execution. Contact us so we can create something unique together.</p>

                            <p>The main task of Login is to unlock and run other programs, as well as to have full control over the entire system. It has an advanced BSAKS lock that protects against unauthorized access.</p>
                            <p>Login allows you to enable or disable selected functions of the entire system and individual programs, giving you full control over their operation. From its level, you can also manage the system, for example, lock it, reset it, or even shut down the device.
                            <br>The program also provides direct access to the Python interpreter and the command line, which allows for advanced configuration and interaction with the system.

                            <br>This program also plays an advanced role in battery control. In preview mode, you can constantly track the charging time or the decrease of each percentage, which provides valuable data for analysis and better energy management.
                            <br><br><b>Security and Locks</b>
                            <br>Notificator is also a key security element of SAKS. Within just 5 seconds of removing the dedicated USB key from the device's port, the system will automatically shut down the computer and block access to all SAKS programs. This extremely fast reaction guarantees that your data remains safe even in case of a physical breach.
                            <br>All Notificator settings are fully configurable from the Login program level. You can enable or disable individual functions there, adjusting the system to your individual needs.</p>

                            <br><em> * volume units (e.g., gallons to liters and vice versa)
                            <br> * lengths (e.g., kilometers to miles)

                            <p>In case of improper operation or removal of the dedicated USB key, SD SAKS automatically shuts down the computer and completely blocks access to all programs, ensuring that your data remains safe even in the most critical situations.</p>

                            <p><em>* Stage 1: The first step is to unlock the Login MOD program through the Login program.
                            <br> * Stage 2: After successfully unlocking Login MOD, you can run the Sysi program, which unlocks the second stage of BSAKS, giving access to most of the programs in the ecosystem.
                            <br>* Stage 3: The last stage of security protects the most sensitive programs.</em></p>
                            <p><b>Special Security for Key Programs</b>
                            <br>Even after passing through the three stages of BSAKS, some programs remain blocked due to their strategic importance. Passaks, Bankier, and IFR are programs that require unlocking the Register to run. Interestingly, the Bankier and IFR programs themselves only need one password, which emphasizes that the key security is access to the Register, which is protected by two passwords.</p>

                            <p>It was enough to provide the content and heading, and the program would automatically generate a ready-made page with a characteristic Kajotte Studio graphic, while also collecting system data, such as the current time.</p>

                            <br> * Multi-level View: The Calendar provides a monthly and yearly view in several versions, allowing for convenient planning and viewing of upcoming events.
                            <br> * Advanced Calculations: Just enter any date, and the program will precisely calculate how many days are left until today or another date you choose. The results are automatically saved in the SAKS memory, which allows them to be quickly pasted into other programs, such as SAKS Notepad.
